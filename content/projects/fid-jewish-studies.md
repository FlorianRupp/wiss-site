# FID Jewish Studies, Phase I und II
The "FID Jewish Studies" is an expert information service (Fachinformationsdienst) for the domain of Jewish studies. This service is developed at the University Library Johann Christian Senckenberg in Frankfurt. WISS takes care of the large-scale data integration and enrichment to contexualize the provided resources and to support innovative retrieval concepts.

In phase II of the project, we take on the challenge to contextualise Compact Memory, a full text database of mainly German newspaper and journal articles from the 19th century. After OCR, we aim for the extraction of named entities and linking to JudaicaLink in order to improve access to this highly valuable corpus.
