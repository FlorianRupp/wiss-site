abstract = {Researchers wishing to study the Japanese visual media domain do not currently have access to a large set of descriptive data for analysis. To remedy this, the Japanese Visual Media Graph project (JVMG) seeks to build a knowledge graph consisting of descriptive metadata sourced from various online fan communities, described using RDF ontologies. To better understand how this informal, crowdsourced data can be both described using a formal ontologies, and made useful to researchers, this paper presents a summary of the properties of community data from a number of fan sites, and discusses the impact it has on the creation of a unified dataset and on possible research use cases. We find that the data sources are of high quality and coverage. They complement each other well and our central ontology should enable these connections between related resources across communities. Certain niche research topics are enabled by the use of community created data alone, but others encourage the incorporation of additional authoritative sources.},

abstract = {Across numerous fan created and curated websites, there exists a wealth of semantically rich descriptive data for a variety of Japanese visual media, such as anime, manga, and video games. The amount and granularity of these data makes it valuable for domain researchers, but the semantic heterogeneity and lack of interconnectedness makes analysis cumbersome. Seeking to address this issue, the Japanese Visual Media Graph (JVMG) project aims to create a type of global database built using RDF and external ontologies to better enable data-driven research in the domain. We discuss the benefits this approach has when compared to the local relational databases used at the fan-sites, such as enabling the easy creation of aggregate resources using data from multiple providers, and the ability to constantly update and alter a schema over time. This encourages the incorporation of additional data in the future, while still maintaining rich data semantics and provenance. While many of the benefits are discussed in the context of the JVMG project or the Japanese visual media domain, we discuss how this database approach may be similarly advantageous to other projects that seek to create aggregate resources, or collect heterogeneous data from diverse sources},
