abstract: "Within this project, we analyze research papers in the social sciences and identify links to variables in surveys they are based on. We use natural language processing and natural language generation to create summaries of the literature to improve access to current research."

# VAriable Detection, Interlinking and Summarization (VADIS)

The key vision behind VADIS is to allow for searching und using survey variables in context and thereby help to increase the reproducibility of research results. We achieve this by combining text mining techniques and semantic web technologies that identify and exploit links between publications, their topics, and the specific variables that are covered in the surveys. These semantic links in scientific texts build the basis for the development of applications to give users better access to scientific literature such as passage search, summarization, and information retrieval.
