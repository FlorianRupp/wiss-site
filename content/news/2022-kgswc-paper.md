Our paper "Easy and complex: new perspectives for metadata modeling using RDF-star and Named Graphs" just got accepted for
the [Knowledge Graph and Semantic Web Conference](http://kgswc.org/). The research emerged collaboratively from the
[CAIUS](http://wiss.iuk.hdm-stuttgart.de/projects/caius/) and the [Judaicalink](http://wiss.iuk.hdm-stuttgart.de/projects/judaicalink/) project.

The paper presents three patterns for meta-layer modeling using RDF-star and Named Graphs.

Here is the full abstract:

> The Resource Description Framework is well-established as
a lingua franca for data modeling and is designed to integrate heterogeneous
data at instance and schema level using statements. While RDF is
conceptually simple, data models nevertheless get complex, when complex
data needs to be represented. Additional levels of indirection with
intermediate resources instead of simple properties lead to higher barriers
for prospective users of the data. Based on three patterns, we argue
that shifting information to a meta-level can not only be used to
(1) provide provenance information, but can also help to (2) maintain
backwards compatibility for existing models, and to (3) reduce the complexity
of a data model. There are, however, multiple ways in RDF to
use a meta-level, i.e., to provide additional statements about statements.
With Named Graphs, there exists a well-established mechanism to describe
groups of statements. Since its inception, however, it has been
hard to make statements about single statements. With the introduction
of RDF-star, a new way to provide data about single statements is
now available. We show that the combination of RDF-star and Named
Graphs is a viable solution to express data on a meta-level and propose
that this meta-level should be used as first class citizen in data modeling.
